		<h1>Running External Javascript</h1>
		<p> This simple web page is designed to let you experimentally run some code in your external JavaScript file. </p>
	
		<p id="target">This is just a boring paragraph. </p> <!-- "target" is a bad name for an id because it's a property of event objects. this can get confusing if you have a page that makes use of event handlers. -->
<!-- this onclick stuff works here, but best practices would have you do this in JavaScript instead of html -->
		<p>
			<button type="button" onclick="doProblem1()">Run Problem 1 Code</button> <!-- this doesn't work because of the way this function is declared in test.js -->
		
		</p>
		<p>
			<button type="button" onclick="doProblem2()">Run Problem 2 Code</button>
		</p>
		<p>
			<button type="button" onclick="doProblem3()">Run Problem 3 Code</button>
		</p>
		<p>
			<button type="button" onclick="doProblem4()">Run Problem 4 Code</button>
		</p>

		<p><strong>Important:</strong> These functions will be stored in an external file called "test.js".</p>
